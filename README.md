# Python_Week7
Data Analysis and Visualization Project
Objective
This project is designed to:

Load and analyze a dataset using the Pandas library in Python.

Perform data exploration and basic analysis.

Create visualizations using the Matplotlib library to gain insights from the data.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (Optional for .ipynb file)

Libraries:

Pandas

Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
Features
This project includes the following tasks:

Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
Load a dataset in CSV format using the Pandas library.

Inspect the dataset by displaying the first few rows.

Check the structure of the dataset, including data types and missing values.

Clean the dataset by filling or dropping missing values.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Compute basic statistics of numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).

Perform grouping on categorical columns and calculate mean values for each group.

Identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.

Task 3: Data Visualization
Create different types of visualizations to analyze the data, including:

Line Chart: For observing trends over time or sequence.

Bar Chart: For comparing numerical values across categories.

Histogram: For understanding the distribution of a numerical column.

Scatter Plot: For visualizing relationships between two numerical variables.

Add titles, labels, and legends to customize the visualizations.

Dataset
The project uses the Iris Dataset as an example.

You can replace it with any dataset of your choice in CSV format.

Ensure the dataset has a mix of numerical and categorical columns for effective analysis.

Usage
Clone this repository or download the project files.

Run the Python script (analysis.py) or Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) to execute the tasks.

Replace the example dataset (iris.csv) with your own dataset if desired.

Output
Data Exploration: Displays the structure of the dataset and handles missing values.

Basic Analysis: Provides summary statistics and group-specific insights.

Visualizations: Outputs clear, informative plots to understand patterns and relationships in the dataset.
